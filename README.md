“In this project, I designed a VB.NET form to accept student data and perform three validations — all fields are mandatory, the name should contain only alphabets, and the student’s age must be 18 or above.
When the Add button is clicked, the program inserts the record into the Access database using OleDb.
When the Preview button is pressed, it displays all the records in the DataGridView using a dataset.
This program demonstrates form validation, parameterized queries, and database connectivity in VB.NET.”
